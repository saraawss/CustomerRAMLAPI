case 1 : Able to consume API using java and Javascript in every 5 min
case 2 : Able to design a mobile application using ionic and Angular calling by customer.impl.CustomerControllerImpl.getCustomers and customer.impl.CustomerControllerImpl.updateCustomerById
case 3 : Able to extend the application to use Orders and Products.In api.raml is extended by adding orders and products and genarating that raml to Order.java and Product.java and controller java classes.Then override rest methods in customer.impl.CustomerControllerImpl.
